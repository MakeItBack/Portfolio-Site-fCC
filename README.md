# Portfolio Site
**My web developers portfolio site.**<br>
Originally built as the 5th and final project for the *Responsive Web Design* course (freeCodeCamp).<br>
(See *freeCodeCampProject* branch of this repo for submitted version.)

This site is built with plain css and html and makes use of flexbox, CSS grid and media queries for a responsive display.
